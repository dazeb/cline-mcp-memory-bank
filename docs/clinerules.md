Memory Bank Integration Rules:

CRITICAL: Before ANY task or response:
1. ALWAYS check active context (memory://active/context):
   - Current project state and mode
   - Ongoing tasks and their status
   - Recent decisions and updates
   - Open questions and concerns

2. ALWAYS review project context (memory://project/context):
   - Technical stack and dependencies
   - Project guidelines and standards
   - Architecture principles
   - Development workflow

3. ALWAYS consult decision log (memory://decisions) for:
   - Previous architectural choices
   - Established patterns
   - Technical rationales
   - Related decisions

4. ALWAYS check progress tracking (memory://progress):
   - Current phase and milestones
   - Completed work
   - In-progress tasks
   - Known blockers

After EVERY task:
1. Update active context with:
   - Task completion status
   - New information learned
   - Changes made

2. Record any technical decisions with:
   - Clear rationale
   - Considered alternatives
   - Impact assessment

3. Update progress tracking:
   - Mark completed items
   - Add new tasks identified
   - Note any blockers found

Key Guidelines:
- NEVER proceed without checking memory bank context
- ALWAYS maintain consistent project state
- Record ALL significant technical decisions
- Track progress in real-time
- Keep context updated with EVERY change
